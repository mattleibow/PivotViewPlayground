                car created by Bertone for the 1967 London Motor Show at Earl's Court. The sleek 2+2

                was designed by Marcello Gandini, perhaps best known for styling the Lamborghini
                Countach. Unusually for a show car, the Pirana was commissioned as a publicity stunt

                for one hundred, compare the Buick Centieme). The Cadillac Cien had a 7.5 L V12
                Northstar XV12 engine, which produced 750 hp (559 kW) and 450 lb·ft (610 N·m) of
                torque. This experimental engine featured direct injection and Displacement on
                Demand, which allowed the engine to run on only six or fewer cylinders under light
                load. The Cien was designed at General Motors' Advanced Design Studio in England and
                built as a fully-working road-going vehicle with the help of the UK-based
                engineering and motorsport company Prodrive. The Cien's low, sleek style was created

                CTS, SRX, XLR and so forth. It was built by Metalcrafters of California in 1998. Its
                engine was, officially anyway, the first Northstar designed for Rear wheel drive

            <Description>The Cadillac Le Mans was a concept car developed by Cadillac in 1953. It
                was named for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France, in which Cadillac competed in
                1950. The design was a low-profile (51 inches (1,300 mm) to the windshield frame),
                two-seat, fiberglass-bodied roadster. This concept showcased Cadillac's first
                wrap-around windshield. It was powered by a 250 hp (186 kW) version of Cadillac's
                331 CI V-8, a power output not reached in production Cadillacs until 1955. The Le
                Mans overall length was 196 in (4978 mm). Though 4 units were built, the model never
                went into production, and it would be nearly 50 years before Cadillac developed
                another vehicle with a similar design concept, the Cadillac XLR. Of the four, one is

            <Description>The Cadillac Orleans was a concept car developed by Cadillac for the 1953
                auto show circuit. It was the first four door hardtop concept. The hardtop design
                eliminated the traditional B-pillar found on most cars of the era. Powered by a
                Cadillac V8 engine with an output of 210 hp (157 kW), the Orleans was never put into
                production. The design innovations on this car would not be put into a production
                car until the 1956 Sedan de Ville. The car also featured suicide doors, a wrap
                around windshield, full air conditioning, and attempts at safety improvements, such
                as the doors only being able to be opened if the car was in neutral. Another unique
                luxury feature was the addition of an AC/DC converter and a normal household outlet
                to allow electronic devices to be plugged into the car. A compartment in the
                backrest held a men's electric razor, a vanity case, and a mirror.</Description>

                32-valve V16 concept engine displacing 13.6 liters (~830 cu. in) and was mated to a
                four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission. The engine featured
                fuel-saving Active Fuel Management technology, much improved from its notorious
                ancestor, debuting in 2004 on some 2005 GM models. On the Sixteen, it would
                seamlessly shut down twelve cylinders in light driving, eight during strenuous
                driving, and only awaken the entire engine under full acceleration. With this
                ingenious system, the engine was capable of 20 mpg Imperial under normal conditions.
                The engine was said to produce 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) using no form of forced

                unlike the Viper, was made more for handling and driving pleasure, while the Viper
                was made more for raw power. The Copperhead had excellent handling due to its low,

                at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show. It was intended to be a modern interpretation of the
                single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilizing a 'saute-vent' ( French for 'change
                wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two
                distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also
                serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5L V10 engine, gives the car a
                distinctly futuristic look. This is also to increase aerodynamicy. The rear view
                mirror is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when
                necessary, or hide it when not in use. Though considered more of a styling exercise
                than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be
                modified slightly from the original computer aided designs. [ dated info ]

                specific design direction by Lexus. The design language of L-finesse was first
                introduced on the LF Series concepts and has now extended to all new vehicles in the
                Lexus lineup. The LF Series vehicles include three coupes/convertibles: the LF-A,
                the LF-A Roadster, and the LF-C; two sedans: the LF-S and LF-Sh; and two crossover
                SUVs: the LF-X and LF-Xh. These vehicles feature new design cues which derive from
                the L-finesse philosophy of "Intriguing Elegance" (純), "Incisive Simplicity" (妙),
                and "Seamless Anticipation" (予). New vehicle technologies include advanced
                instrumentation, multiple driver-selected vehicle configurations, hybrid and
                experimental powertrains, and unconventional driver interface designs. The first
                concept vehicle of the LF Series, the LF-X, appeared in 2003. Several of the LF
                concept vehicles have appeared close to their production counterparts, while the
                design cues of other LF concepts appeared on more distinctly different production

            <Description>The Maserati Tipo 61 (commonly referred to as the Maserati Birdcage) is one
                of the best known sports racing cars of the early 1960s. The car was produced
                between 1959 and 1961 by Maserati for racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance
                classic. It became famous for its intricate tubular space frame chassis, containing
                about 200 chro-moly steel tubes welded together, hence the nickname "Birdcage". This
                method of construction provided a more rigid and, at the same time, lighter chassis
                than other sports cars of the time. By recessing the windscreen base into the
                bodywork, Maserati was able to reduce the effect of new Le Mans rules demanding a
                tall windscreen. The Camoradi team became famous racing the Tipo 61's but, despite
                being faster round the track than other cars, the Birdcage was unreliable and often
                retired from races due to problems with the gearbox. The Maserati MC12 is available
                only in white and blue, to serve as a tribute to the Tipo 61 and the Camoradi racing

            <Description>Mazda RX-01 is a concept car produced by Mazda Motor Corporation that
                debuted at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show. Created partially in response to the state of
                the economy at the time and the resultant shrinkage of the high-end sports car
                market, the RX-01 undertook a back-to-basics approach of a compact, simple,
                fun-to-drive, yet inexpensive sports car much like the first generation RX-7. (By
                this time, the RX-7 had evolved into an uncompromising "super sports car" boasting
                ultra high performance with little creature comfort and a high price tag.) The RX-01
                boasted a radical front end with a floating bumper/spoiler made possible by its
                compact rotary engine as well as a claimed true 2+2 seating arrangement. More
                significantly, however, it marked the first public appearance of the next generation
                of Mazda rotary engine design, the 13B-MSP. A naturally-aspirated engine, its
                exhaust ports are now located in the side housing instead of the periphery of the
                rotor housing, thus preventing overlapping intake and exhaust port timing. This has
                several benefits: higher output, improved thermal efficiency, better fuel economy,
                and cleaner emissions. While it was hoped by enthusiasts that the RX-01 would be put
                into production as the next iteration of Mazda's rotary sports car and made
                available to world markets (the RX-7 was discontinued in North America after 1995),
                the declining interest in sports car over SUVs and Mazda's financial state at the
                time conspired to keep RX-01 merely a concept car. However, the 13B-MSP would go on
                to be further developed into the eventual RENESIS engine that powers the RX-8.</Description>

                design centre at La Garenne, and the opening of a new one at Vélizy. The car wasn't
                designed to go into production, but just to be a prototype featuring Peugeot's new
                designing techniques. The engine is mounted just behind the front wheels and side
                exhausts exit behind each of the front wheels. Unlike many concepts, the 907 is
                capable of being driven like a real car.</Description>

                off road car powered by two diesel engines that drive the front and rear wheels in a
                four wheel drive configuration. The car principally consists of a one-piece carbon
                honeycomb body reinforced by two upper longitudinal roll-over bars completed from
                stainless steel, each with a diameter of 76 mm (3 in). These tubes also serve as an
                air intake and air conduit to the front engine (left-hand tube) and rear engine
                (right-hand tube). Both engine displaces 2168 cc and produces power of around 180
                bhp (134 kW). The two engines consequently supply a collective power of nearly 360
                bhp (268 kW) and a maximum torque of 800 N·m (590 lb·ft).</Description>

                utilises hydrogen fuel cells and has an electric motor on each of the four wheels.
                All four motors combined give the Quark 30kW or 40hp. It can drive about 130
                kilometres (81 mi) before it requires refueling. The Quark is 2.38 metres (94 in)
                long and 1.50 metres (59 in) wide. The empty weight is 450 kg (992 lb) and its top
                speed is 110 km/h (68 mph). It can accelerate to 50 km/h (31 mph) in 6.5 seconds,
                and can carry two people with an additional load of 140 kg (309 lb). Although it may
                look like an ATV, it is considerably larger and not designed for true off road
                conditions. Because of its low ground clearance and short range, it would be more

                (fenders) were designed to absorb impacts and revert to their original shape. They
                were made of Aramid fiber (Twaron or Kevlar) reinforced composites. The side doors
                featured carbon-fibre side impact protection. Most of the parts were from the Saab
                900 Turbo 16 and modified, but the seats came from a Chevrolet Corvette. The engine
                was tuned to give 285 hp (213 kW). The top speed was 270 km/h (168 mph) and 0 to 100
                km/h (62 mph) acceleration took 5.9 seconds. An interesting feature is that the
                speedometer lights only illuminate the area around the current speed. A feature
                incorporated as standard, in modified form, on later production models.</Description>

                235 miles per U.S. gallon or 282 mpg Imperial ). This stems from the International
                System of Units unit of fuel efficiency, which is the number of litres of fuel
                required to travel 100 kilometers. To achieve such economy, it is produced with
                lightweight materials, a streamlined body and an engine and transmission designed
