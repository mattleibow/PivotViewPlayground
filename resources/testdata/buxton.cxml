	        <p>Originally released in 1996, the CyKey was a designed as an inexpensive means to enable people to employ the chording technique originally developed for the Microwriter to enter alphanumeric data into a PC or PDA, such as a Palm Pilot.</p>
          <p>One could always enter data to your PC using the serial connector.  However, that was cumbersome, and, it required an entire Microwriter, rather than just a keypad, which is what the CyKey provided.</p>
          <p>The other thing that the CyKey brought to the equation was the ability to use it with either the left or the right hand.  Hence, despite the additional keys on the keypad, it used the standard Microwriter codes.  The extra keys were to accommodate left or right handed use on the same physical device, and to compensate for the slight asymmetry in the Microwriter (and AgendA) keyboard layouts.</p>
          <p>As Chri Rainey,  the designer of the CyKey explained to me:</p>
          <blockquote>In an updated CyKey it was apparent that the original design of the CyKey was rather clunky and was done on a shoe string. During the life of the product it was criticised for being rather large, noisy (clicking keys), a left hand version was a special, the cable connecting the unit to the PC was a nuisance.
          <br /><br />
          In order to address the problems the Mk 2 CyKey specification evolved.
          <br /><br />
          The size was set by using the ergonomics that were so successful on the AgendA. So the basic key set up of the AgendA set the position of the CyKey keys. The AgendA keys can be superimposed on the CyKey. . 
          <br /><br />
          To address the problem of having the single unit for LH and RH operation I noted that a mirror of the AgendA key meant that we had 2 little finger keys and the key had to be elongated to accommodate the  antisymmetry of the AgendA keys. This turned out so be advantageous as it gave a bigger surface area and gave 2 keys with which you can press with the little finger, thereby answering a further problem which is that young children had a job spanning the full keyboard.
          <br /><br />
          The cable was done away with by using IR (this was chosen as it has the potential to be very low power - 12 months + battery life). A lot of work was carried out to ensure that the error rate was very low by having a strong error checking algorithm.</blockquote>

        <![CDATA[ 
	      <p>First released in 2002, the FrogPad is an interesting 1-handed keyboard having 20 keys. The way that one can get the full alphabet in upper and lower case, as well as all of the numbers, punctuation and special characters is not to rely on one-key-per-character.  Hence, the FrogPad is a chord keyboard – but one that has more keys than the 5 – 8 seen on most.  The result is that entering a character requires only 2 keys to be pressed, at most.  The higher number of 1-key characters and the restriction to two key chords means that higher typing speeds are more likely possible on this device than chord keyboards with fewer keys but more complex, and more frequent chords – all things being equal (such as quality of design of the key mappings).</p>
	      <p>There are two layouts available for the device:  one for typing with the left hand, the other for typing with the right.  Each is a mirror-image of the other, which reflects the mirror-image layout of the hands.</p>
	      <p>The interesting question that this provokes is this:  should a right-handed person use the right or the left hand version of the device?  As always, the correct answer is, "It depends."  In this case, one of the prime factors is this:  do you want to use it in conjunction with a mouse?  If so, then generally, you would likely be best to adopt a FrogPad that is designed for use by your non-mouse hand (most typically, your non-dominant hand).  The good news is, due to the mirror-image mapping of the keys on the left and right hand keyboards, moving from one to the other should require only little adjustment.</p>
	      <p>Of course, each instance of "likely", "typically", "generally" and "should" indicates something that could be tested and quantified, which is my way of providing a concrete example illustrating how formal user studies can shed light on design questions.</p>

	      <p>My Microwriter is one of my favourite things in my collection, one that I have had the longest, and one that I used the most.  It is also on that taught me the most – both in terms of facts, but also in terms of appreciating the difference between intellectual and experiential learning.  That is, I gained insights about the subtleties and nature of human skill from it that I would not have gotten from the literature alone, and through that, a lesson that has stood me in good stead ever since. </p>
	      <p>The Microwriter was, I believe, the world’s first portable digital word processor.  It was first shown in 1978. This unit dates from circa 1980. One types with a 6 button one-handed chording keyboard. That is, your fingers are always in “home position” (the thumb being the only digit to alternate between two keys) and you enter text by pushing combinations of buttons, or “chords”.  Hence, you could (and I would) stand in the subway, hold on to the car for balance with one hand, and type with the other.  I just needed to hold the device against my chest with the palm of the same hand that I typed with.   It could also be connected to your PC as a substitute for your QWERTY keyboard. </p>
	      <p>My one complaint is that that I always felt that the right-handed version should be used in the left hand, rather than the right.  Why?  For the same reason that Engelbart used his chord keyboard in the non-dominant hand:  so that the dominant hand could be utilized for pointing and selecting, using a mouse for example, when working at one’s desk.  </p>
	      <p>This desire to use it in either hand led to another observation around the mnemonics used in teaching the chording scheme.  Yes, my unit still works, and one can learn to touch type in about 60 minutes (a good thing, since one rapidly discovers that with chord keyboards, there is no hunt-and-peck option; you can either touch type or you can’t type at all).  But look at the materials that are given to teach you how to type.  Here we see something really interesting. </p>
	      <p>Look at the aids used to remember the following letters.  In each case, the character (in red) is drawn over a stylized representation, and inverted V shape, of the positions of the five digits of the right hand: </p>
	      <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	      <tr><td style="border-top: 1px solid silver; border-left: 1px solid silver;"><img src="a/J.png"/>&nbsp;<img src="a/L.png"/></td><td style="vertical-align: text-top; border-top: 1px solid silver; border-right: 1px solid silver; padding: 0px 10px;">For the letters J and L, the mnemonic reinforces the shape of the letter, with the three fingers involved representing the end-points of the lines defining the character.</td></tr>
	      <tr><td style="border-top: 1px solid silver; border-left: 1px solid silver;"><img src="a/S.png"/></td><td style="vertical-align: text-top; border-top: 1px solid silver; border-right: 1px solid silver; padding: 0px 10px;">In the case of S, the mnemonic used employs word association.  One is to use the knowledge that one wears one’s <b>S</b>ignet ring on the ring finger to remember that the letter S is typed using that one finger.</td></tr>
	      <tr><td style="border-top: 1px solid silver; border-bottom: 1px solid silver; border-left: 1px solid silver; vertical-align: text-top;"><img src="a/Space.png"/>&nbsp;<img src="a/E.png"/></td><td style="vertical-align: text-top; border-top: 1px solid silver; border-bottom: 1px solid silver; border-right: 1px solid silver; padding: 0px 10px;">In the case of SPACE and the letter E, yet a different class of mnemonic is exploited, namely, the knowledge that those are the two most common characters in English, and that the thumb and index finger are the most dexterous digits, and that single button actions are simpler and faster to execute than chords.  Hence, the E and SPACE are mapped to single button pushes using those most agile digits.</td></tr>
	      </table>
	      <p>There are three really fascinating things that pop if you consider even these three cases carefully: </p>
	      <ol>
	      <li>When learning, there is this funny process that you follow where you first try to remember the class of mnemonic, and then the mnemonic itself.</li>
	      <li>There are cultural and linguistic biases in the coding.  First, “signet ring” is quintessentially English, not American, so will be found to be quaint rather than especially useful.  Second, the dominance of “e” over other characters does not necessarily carry over into all languages that employ this alphabet. </li>
	      <li>Most significantly, notice that if one was to switch, and try to apply one’s skill using the other hand, that the first spatial-based mnemonic would naturally transfer by spatial congruence, while the second and third would transfer by mirror image.  Try using mirror image, and suddenly the shape for J gives an L, and vice versa. </li>
	      </ol>
	      <p>I am conflicted in all of this.  Why?  Because on the one hand, I think that the <i>New User’s Guide</i> is one of the best examples of technical writing that I have ever seen in a user’s manual.  I love the parallel use of different representations to get the message across.  I really appreciated it when I was learning, and think that the manual is worth studying for its approach (compare it to those produced for the other chord keyboards that I discuss, as a really good exercise!). </p>
	      <p>On the other hand, there is this issue that, in preparing the pedagogical approach, and the associated mental models that would result, they did not anticipate using the device in either or both hands, and thereby inadvertently built in some road-blocks.  </p>
	      <p>This is understandable, given that the design was done before the mouse was commercially available, much less the GUI.  But that just signals all the more need for caution and looking further forward in our own decisions – which risk falling into the same trap.  One that – when you move to looking at the Microwriter’s descendent, the CyKey (which is designed to be used by either hand), the Microwriter decisions ran into at full steam. </p>
	      <p>In the larger scheme of things, not a huge problem.  But a problem nevertheless. </p>
	      <p>I still have a soft-spot for this device, and everything that it represents! </p>

        <p>First released in November 2007, the Kindle used the same e-ink reflective B&amp;W display as many others, such as the Sony PRS-500. However, it differed in many other ways. The bezel below the screen had a small physical QWERTY keyboard incorporated into it that enabled one to annotate the document being read. This was accomplished by attaching what amounted to electronic sticky notes to the text. These could be hidden or revealed. There was also a search capability which enabled one to type in search terms (which may be in the text itself, or, in your personal "sticky notes" attached to it. You could also use the keyboard to look up words in the built-in dictionary. </p>
        <p>The Kindle also had a wireless connection that let one order e-books pretty much anywhere and anytime in the USA, and have them delivered instantly. This was facilitated by the tight integration with Amazon's on-line book store. </p>
        <p>This device illustrates that the quality of the user experience is not just about the device itself; rather, how it is integrated into the larger ecosystem of reading – things like annotation, browsing titles, looking things up, and purchasing. </p>
        <p>Because of this larger integration, the Kindle family of e-readers rapidly came to dominate the e-reader market. Hence, prior to the release of the Apple iPad in 2010, I suspect that few imagined that Amazon's position in this space was vulnerable. </p>
        <p>I think the lesson here is, for those who have market dominance, never assume that you can't be challenged, and quickly. And, for those not dominant, remember that with well executed innovation, you can obtain a strong foothold in a market that has an established dominant player. Note that I didn't say that it would be easy. But it can be done. </p>
        <p>To add the next chapter on this moral, it is worth noting how Amazon responded to the challenge of the iPad. First, they played to their strength, namely, the fact that you could read outdoors, such as at the beach – something that you cannot do on an iPad. At the same time, they improved the quality of the e-ink display. But they also kept true to their core value: having the design augment the quality of the larger reading experience. My favourite example is a seeming small detail, namely, enabling power to be carried over to the optional leather binder in order to provide a built-in retractable reading light. As Gustave Flaubert and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe are both purported to have said, <i>God is in the details</i>. </p>

        <![CDATA[
	      <p>Announced Dec. 2005 and shipped July 2006, this iLiad is the first e-reader that I owned.  I bought it for a few reasons.  To explain the primary one, namely screen size, one needs to know something about e-readers and pagination. </p>
	      <p>The size of the screen of most e-readers is about the same as that of a pocket-book.  Hence, if the print version of the book was in that format, then what appears on the screen can be a pretty close facsimile of the print version – especially if the original did not incorporate colour. </p>
	      <p>The challenge is what to do if the book was formatted for a page larger than the screen of the e-reader?  There are really three options.  </p>
	      <ol>
	      <li><b>Shrink the page to fit the screen.</b>  If the size difference is small, this may be acceptable.  However, the chances are very good that this will make the page unreadable, especially for those – like me – of a certain age, where reading glasses are the rule rather than the exception.</li>
	      <li><b>Keep the size, and show only part of the page</b>:  This is kind of what we do with web pages that are too large for the window in which we are viewing them.  Yes, what you see is legible.  But also, there is a lot of fussing about having to pan around the screen, thereby interfering with the flow of reading, and also, preventing one from getting an overview of the page as a whole.</li>
	      <li><b>Repaginate / Reformat the document</b>:  this is what happens with many books.  If one does away with the notion of a predetermined page size, one can flow the contents onto the e-reader screen on an "as fits" basis.  One of the benefits of this is that the option is there to change the size of the font (and therefore the amount of text on the page) to accommodate those who may be vision impaired, for example.  The bad news is that essentially all of the craft invested in the original book design – in terms of the placement of components, or layout, are lost.  In text only books, this may not be a huge issue – depending on the book.  But with books with a high graphic component – such as my Sketching book – it destroyed an important aspect of the book.</li>
	      </ol>
	      <p>As with most design options, there is generally never a single "right" (or "wrong") option.  It all depends on the person doing the reading, and their intent, the nature of the material being red, and the technology being used. </p>
	      <p>For me, the fact was that most of what I need the e-reader for was for unpublished documents that were in the form of PDF files formatted for 8 ½" x 11" (or A4), about 2,000 pages of which I needed to cart around with me on airplanes in 2006.  Hence, I went for the e-Reader with the largest screen at the time, this one, the iLiad. </p>
	      <p>But there was one other factor that made this device my choice.  It was, and pretty much still is, the only e-reader that came with a high-resolution stylus, and the capability to mark up documents with digital ink, and then transfer the marked-up versions to one's PC to be sent on to the appropriate person.  I loved this. </p>
	      <p>At this stage, one might ask, "Why didn't you just read the documents on your Tablet-PC?  It had a stylus and big screen!"  Good point, and a relevant and interesting one.  Largely, it had a lot to do with the quality of the reading experience, size, weight, and battery life.  On planes, the experience is night and day, even taking into account how slow it is to turn pages with an e-ink display.  But more to the point, I did a lot of my reading outside, sitting in our garden.  That is one of the pleasures of reading.  It is a pleasure that is simply not possible with any slate-format device that has an LCD display – including (and perhaps especially) the iPad.  </p>
	      <p>But why didn't I continue with the iLiad?  The answer is rooted in a couple things, the first of which is one of my main complaints with the design of far too many digital appliances.  Yes, it was wonderful to have this thin, light device with relatively long battery life.  But, no, I hated the amount of paraphernalia (power supplies, cables, etc.) that I had to carry around in order to use it (remembering that "reading" the words off of the page is just part of the broader activity of reading.  The other part was the quality of customer support and service.  As far as I can see, iRex was never large enough or well enough funded to properly support their product.  They were a classic example of the observation that it is not enough to have an innovative technology.  One needs an innovative company – technologically, business-wise, and from a design perspective.  They went out of business. </p>
	      <p>But one last point, that plays on this last point, more than a little.  The iLiad came naked – just the bare e-reader (as do most).  Somewhere along the way, I bought the most expensive (circa $50) leather case for it – just to see how that affected my perception and use of the device.  The fact is, I was staggered at the result.  It transformed my relationship to it – even though it came close to tripling how thick it was.  It was no longer some hard cold consumer electronics device.  It became softer, more organic, and something that felt good to hold.  There is an important lesson in this somewhere.  </p>

	      <p>This was Sony's second generation e-reader, and the first to be released in North America (2006).  It employs an e-ink reflective display.  One interacts with it using buttons along the bottom of the screen as well as a few other controls below the buttons.</p>
	      <p>One of the challenges of the design was the discrepancy between the orientation of the numbered physical controls (horizontal), and the virtual ones along the right margin (vertical) which they controlled.</p>
	      <p>There were other issues too, which became clear with the release of the Amazon Kindle.  Prime among these was that the success of an e-reader was not dependent on its quality as a reading device alone.  Rather, the ability to access and perform other functions associated with the activity of reading, such as looking up words, buying books, making annotations, was also important.</p>
	      <p>The underlying lesson here is that it is risky to think of devices in terms of a specific task, rather than something that supports, and augments the experience of, an activity, and  even that, within the larger ecosystem in which that activity is situated.</p>

	      <p>This is a wonderful PDA that I purchased in 1984, the year it was released.  It was remarkable in that one could enter data either by using the mechanical keypad, or by printing the characters, one on top of the other, on the touch pad on the right.  In this latter regard, it used the same basic technology as its sibling, the Casio AT-550 Calculator Watch, which is also in the collection. </p>
	      <p>There are a few details, positive and negative that are worth delving into.
	      <p>First, notice that the touch pad has a labeled grid printed on it.  That is because it could be used in two ways.  This is because you could enter numbers into the calculator in two ways: </p>
	      <ol>
	      <li>You could just print them, using gestures, number – by – number, as mentioned above, and shown in the figure from the manual.</li>
	      <li>You could use the grid as a virtual calculator keypad, the keys of which are defined and labeled by the grid drawn on the touch pad.  </li>
	      </ol>
	      <p>How touches were interpreted, as gestures or key pushes, was determined by what mode you requested.  What is interesting is how this illustrates the way that a touch pad can support different types of interaction, even on the same device. </p>
	      <p>Another thing that was interesting about this device is that, when entering names – such as looking up someone's phone number in the address book – it had good auto completion. </p>
	      <p>The fact is, this was a really good electronic organizer from all kinds of perspectives.  So why did it take another 12 years – until 1996 and the release of the original Palm Pilot – for PDAs to really take hold?  I would argue that one of the primary reasons had nothing to do with the primary features of the organizer.  Rather, it was the lack of integration with your PC, which meant that you had to manually enter everything into the device, what was in it was gone if you lost it or it broke, since there was no back-up, and there was no way to keep it synchronized with the address list, calendar, etc. that you had on your PC.  That is, it functioned in a separate universe.  </p>
	      <p>There is a key lesson here which I think is going to come back and bite us again with the gadgets of today, namely, without tight and seamless integration with the rest of the ecosystem, the potential of the devices that we have will not be met, regardless of how well they function as an "island". </p>
	      <p>Nevertheless, this was pretty cool for 1984 – the same year that the first Apple Macintosh came out – 17 Moore's Laws ago! </p>

	      <p>Magic Cap was a pretty interesting operating system that was used on a family of PDA devices, beginning with the Sony <i>Magic Link IC</i>-1000, launched in 1994.  It came out of a company called General Magic, started by Bill Atkinson, Andy Herzfeld, and Marc Porat, and spun out of Apple.  (Atkinson and Herzfeld had both been key members of the team that developed the software for the original Macintosh.)  </p>
	      <p>The unit that I have, the Data Rover 840, was released in 1988 and ran the 3.0 version of the software, which was much faster and refined than the original.  This version had good reviews,<sup>1</sup> however this didn't prevent the Magic Cap devices from failing in the market place .  That does not make them uninteresting, however. </p>
	      <p><img src="a/m/IMG_4557.png" align="left" width="292" style="margin: 4px 10px 10px 0px;"/>One interacted with the Magic Cap user interface via a touch screen that was sensitive to either your finger or a stylus.  Unlike almost all commercial graphical user interfaces, which use 2D graphics, what one saw on the Magic Cap screen was rendered as 3D line-art, and, the metaphor used was one or rooms, rather than a desktop.  </p>
	      <p>In one of those rooms, your office, you did find your desk.  It was drawn in   perspective.  On it sat a drawing of your address book, Rolodex, phone, drawers, etc.   You clicked on each to get the associated capability.  Hence, for example, clicking on the Rolodex gave you your address cards, which were – of course – graphically rendered to represent Rolodex cards. </p>
	      <p>From your office, you could go into the hallway (by clicking on the menu item in the top right corner of the screen), within which you saw the doors to the rooms that were available to enter.  These included the Library (where you found reference books, such as dictionaries, etc.), the games room, and a storage room.  </p>
	      <p>The notion of a 3D graphical user interface is one that is proposed to me from time to time.  Generally, those who propose it are unaware of Magic Cap, or earlier examples of the rooms metaphor, such as Henderson &amp; Card (1986)<sup>3</sup> or the 1984 Learning Company game, <i>Robot Odyssey</i><sup>4</sup>.</p>
	      <p>Apart from it just being a really interesting and important device in the history of PDAs and pen-computing, this is a special device because it is the first gadget that I bought on e-bay.  This prompted a great insight:   that without writing a line of code, I could "construct" a working interactive prototype of a concept, simply by buying a device from the site (in this case, a brand new vintage Data Rover on e-bay for $27).  This is partially why I view e-bay as one of the most important and inexpensive sketching and prototyping technologies available to the designer.  </p>
	      <p>A key lesson is to recognize that we can create renderings of concepts by either synthesis or sampling.  Drawing, writing code, or building physical models are examples of <i>synthesis</i>. Finding and collecting existing embodiments of the concept from the physical world is sampling.  Creativity and imagination, coupled with a  knowledge of history and what to look for, are key tools in effectively applying either approach. </p>

	      <p>Launched in June 1997, this was product that inspired a deep emotional attachment to its users.  It supported an outstanding keyboard, coupled with both touch  and stylus input.  Most impressive, from my perspective, was the spectacular industrial design,  done by Martin Riddiford of Therefore Design. </p> 
	      <p>The device had perhaps the best keyboard of any device of its class.  Rather than requiring the development of new typing skills (with the thumbs, for example), it had great action and was such that one could touch-type on it.  And yet, the whole clam-shell design folded up into a compact package which would not be out of place even today.  Part of this was accomplished by using excellent materials, and some by excellent design.  To appreciate the latter, besides just typing on the device, watch how the keyboard folds in and out while opening and closing.  This can best be seen by looking at it from the side. </p>
	      <p>This keyboard mechanism not only made the whole thing feel less cramped when open, it is also what enabled it to fold up as small as it did.  But it served another important purpose.  It shifted the centre of gravity of the device when using it.  Take your regular clam-shell laptop design of today, and poke the screen with your finger as if you were using a touch screen – regardless of if you have one or not.  What you will almost inevitably experience is the screen flopping back-and-forth from your touch, since it was never designed to be used that way.  With the Psion 5, the screen pivots with the keyboard as the device is opened.  The result is that the chassis of the device serves as a kind of back-stop when pressure is applied to the screen surface by either a finger or stylus.  Just careful, thoughtful design. </p>
	      <p>The Series 5 ran the Simbian operating system, and in essence, Simbian – which has subsequently been widely used on mobile phones, is kind of what Psion morphed into.  The applications on the device were pretty impressive, including a word processor that could incorporate graphics created with the included drawing program.  It also has a spell checker.  And, perhaps a reality check in terms of what is possible, it provided 30 hours of use on two AA batteries</p>
	      <h3>References</h3>
	      <p>The story of the Series 5 is told really well on the following web site: </p>

        <![CDATA[
	      <p>The Trackpoint is a little device with a big story.  In this case, a story of the down-and-dirty, roll-up-your-sleeves, be persistent, aspect of innovation.  It is also a story that I would rather you hear from the person who told it to me, Ted Selker, the person mainly behind the technology.  So here it is, in his own words:
	      <blockquote>
	      <p>Bill - let me tell you a little story about Trackpoint!</p>
	      <p>It all started in 1984 when I got my hands on Stewart Card and Tom Moran's new book, Human Computer Interaction. </p>
	      <p>I was amazed to notice that in the first reported mouse experiments by Bill English and Doug Englebart in the first few minutes people did better with a simple knee bar than with a mouse…. I thought,   now a knee has no big representation on the pre- central gyrus of the central sulcus for perception or on the post-central gyrus for motion like the hand does…..  So, why would it start out doing better?  A few pages later I read some data that showed that going to the mouse took more than .7 seconds and coming back to the keyboard from it took more than .9 seconds…...  Ahha! , I said- if a hand doesn't yet know how to use a mouse it won't yet be better at pointing than if a knee that doesn't yet know how to point … and so the time of transit to and from the keyboard will dominate.</p>
	      <p>I went about thinking of places to put a pointing device that the hand could nab from the home row position… I tried in front of the keyboard … and yes made a mechanical claptrap that year that had X and Y excursion to do this.   I also played with an erasure on top of a X/Y joystick that the thumb would control below the space bar.   I considered a joystick between the hands, but then started working on using the J key as a joystick.  </p>
	      <p>At that time a student at Stanford started trying to prototype it based on my ideas but it was time to go off to Atari.  I thought about it there at Atari, but nothing ever got out of the Atari Sunnyvale research lab….</p>
	      <p>I wrote it up as a patent in April of 1984 or so and submitted it.  (I can get more data to you about this if you like)  I believe I happened to be talking about this idea at CHI around the Tektronix people… which begat J-mouse … years later after they left Tektronix.</p>
	      <p>I went to PARC  for a year… and did many fun things there with automatic graphic design to a narrow-waisted mouse that can be held like a pen….  I went to IBM In August of 1985 and  I did tell them I had this patent pending. (I also had a stylus pointing device patent that should be more exploited .. but that is another story too).  So I didn't work on it till a math department colleague Joe Rutledge who wanted to break out of the math world chose it as the idea I had he wanted to collaborate on.  We worked on it on the side to begin with… in 1987.  </p>
	      <p>Joe chose it instead of my big visual interface or intelligent user interface ideas because it seemed that it could change a current product in a noticeable way easily…. I thought of it as a science fair project that would take 6 weeks… I was wrong.   </p>
	      <p>I fixed a microscope that was being thrown out by reglueing its mirrors; I found an oscilloscope that wasn't being used and then found an on piece of bench in the back of a lab to use.    At first my idea was to use conductive foam beneath a key as the joystick.  I put copper foil corners on the top and a foil bottom… I found that the conductive foam at Radio Shack didn't have the hysteresis that the other chip-holding foam had. The sensor was great in that it was sensitive and fit under a key and was easy to make- but   it sucked in that it was where I learned about the problems with force-sensing resistors.  They seem to always be nonmonotonic  and non-repeating … at more than 10%.  This made calibration impossible. Next we tried making a cute cantilevered under-the-key system for making a 4-piezoelectric sensor .  These were beautiful - sensitive and clean but they needed to be grounded out to have a stable beginning to their excursion.  We made a ground that  the piezoelectric devices  would touch whe	n the key was not pressed….Ugh… piezioelectrics have drift when pointing for long, and grounds are not reliable at the tiny signal level they have. Piezioelectrics are not at all good for DC analog measurement.  I got so mad that I went to Ashok Chandra, my boss, and said I wanted him to spend $500 on a Measurement Systems joystick;  one needs a  good signal  to do anything!  He looked at me gravely, let the moment stretch and then said, "Get two".</p>
	      <p>Joe had programmed on the Eniac in the early 1950's and built many things in his life.  I now easily taught a brilliant Joe with a photographic memory digital electronics. And in a few weeks we had made a circuit that put out mouse quadrature signals.</p>
	      <p>Joe learned Basic easily.  We did the really important piece; we built a human factors testing  maze that ran on a discarded PC.  The maze was of 16 characters all over the screen, some short distances, some long, to see how the joystick worked with Fitt's law.…. </p>
	      <p>Oops! I had thought that placing the joystick in the keyboard was the hard part - making it point well was harder.  Hmmm, somehow it was hard to control; we fiddled with feedback resistors and capacitors trying to create transfer functions to make good pointing… yuk… </p>
	      <p>So now we decided to tear off the signal conditioning stuff on the prototype boards and go into an A/D board in the PC.  This was the next cool thing.</p>
	      <p>We tried various transfer functions:  linear, S curve, but found it confusing.  So now we built a graphical interface for designing a transfer function that went through arbitrarily drawn places in the force-to-velocity space.  Just like others' joystick experiences, it skated over the material but  when you wanted to stop you couldn't. It would overshoot and you had to move it slowly back to where you meant to stop. Why did you have to go past something you were selecting, stop and backtrack? We read about overshoot in joysticks. People had theories that it was the fact that rate control was the derivative of position that made position control superior.  We fiddled and fiddled - after a short time though we discovered a weird thing.  We made a transfer function for the pointing stick that hurt your finger but could make selections  25% faster than any reported joystick  ever.  Grrr-  it hurt and there was a dent in my finger when I used it.   Why was it faster when I pressed with 5 kg of force (thank you Measurement Systems for a sturdy sensitive sensor)?  Now Joe and I were having fun.  Gosh, we even got a 6 foot wide office to turn into our lab.</p>
	      <p>At first I thought that this magnificent improvement in selection speed was due to the increased dynamic range of muscles for force control.   It felt so much like two actions, a coarse motion and a fine motion, that I even looked to no avail for literature about different kinds of  muscular control. We made a program to test finger force control.  The idea was a circle on the screen representing X and Y force space that you had to hold a cursor within.  The force space made the cursor feel like it was on spring so you had to press a certain hardness to get it to the circle.  The circle size represented your stability and its position on the screen represented how much pressure you had to apply. Wow was this weird… we discovered you could only hold the finger in the circle with like 5 or so bits of resolution. Gosh, so little control. And wow, the force control didn't get much better beyond 8 oz of pressure.  We drafted a paper, and it got rejected from CHI… sigh… We were too busy to deal with it.  So we 	hummed and hawed and decided that the pain stopped you from pressing the cursor to go faster than you could control it.  Eureka, by making a transfer function that didn't go fast we could make selections 25% faster than the literature reported with a light touch that didn't hurt!  We called this the eye tracking speed, though we never took the time to  get eye tracking equipment for this project to measure a person's ballistic eye motions.  We were happy, so we tried others using it.  Yes, users were faster at making selections, but they didn't like the sluggishness.  So we added a steep  "turbo charge" gain segment to the transfer function where you press hard  to make the cursor goes super-fast. This didn't change the data but made the users happy.  We didn't know why.</p>
	      <p>Many months later, when we were using it in Window applications (on my lovely 3645 Lisp machine) I finally realized that the "turbo charge" part allowed me to toss the cursor across the screen …to change window context. Fine motion was also a concern, and we went back to our 5 bit force resolution result and thought  that  if you don't have much control at slow speeds then tremor would increase inaccuracy and maybe a constant speed would be easier to stop on a dime with…. Sure enough a constant speed selection gave a 15% improvement over controllable slow speed in activities like single pixel selection.</p>
	      <p>Before any of this worked, somehow the inventor of RISC, John Cock came to hear about our input device. He liked it- but then,  a few weeks later he had a stroke.   Abe Peled , VP of IBM computer science research, went to see him.  When asked what he wanted,  John surprised the visitor by stating  "I want one of Ted's pointing devices so I can use my computer in bed." Luckily it was now working well enough for a good demo.   James McGroddy (soon to be General Manager of research)  came to see what we had done.   Sadly, the pointing device was not packaged to send to the hospital and work on someone's computer yet.  But now people were interested.  Ashok ordered us to be extravagant and make John Cock and 96 other interesting people  hand-made pointing stick adorned keyboards .  At this time, IBM made me abandon my patent as terms of continued work on my device and on my research and thesis about adaptive help… it was a difficult moment and an exciting one.</p>
	      <p>We wanted to get the PCcompany to see our in-keyboard pointing device. To get it to really work in a keyboard was complicated.  We had to replace the large Measurement System's joystick package. We bought the silicon strain gauges used in the fancy joysticks but it took us a month to learn how to mount them.  Picking up one of these expensive silicon gauges by its gold leads broke it.  I borrowed an X/Y/Z stage from the microscopy guys.  It was so difficult to manipulate the tiny thing under a microscope. Finally I had the idea of pressing a piece of clay into the sensor holder to pick it up.  At that point the clay mounted to the desk and pressing it close to the sensor moved it towards a strain beam it could be mounted on.  Pressing the lump near the desk moved it very very little.,.  When the strain gauge was in place, the superglue came out.  Others at IBM research started using our micromanipulation technique.</p>
	      <p>The PC division had us show the device to the people making a laptop; they couldn't be convinced it was necessary or would be reliable.  We showed it to a bank- the bank wrote a letter stating that using this would save them on the real-estate needed in an office to leave mouse pads at the clerks' counters- they would buy  $40,000,000 worth of IBM PCs if the company would sell them PCs with the pointing stick in it.  The PC company declined.  I showed the pointing stick to the design team in Armonk- one Richard Saper gave me 1 minute, he tried to draw a circle - we had optimized for text editing -  he said it can't draw a circle and walked out… We learned to stop optimizing for text editing and Saper became an important supporter and even chose the color red for what would be called the TrackPoint. We always hoped that a driver would make the cursors optimize for the purposes they needed the cursor for-  this hasn't happened yet.</p>
	      <p>We finally got so frustrated that I told the PC division that if they didn't use it I would publish in 6 months.  I reminded them of my "bet my badge" deadline as  the  time approached.    At the last moment, the lawyer relented and helped me submit the paperwork correctly  </p>
	      <p>As soon as we showed the device in Cambridge, England at Interact it was obvious it was a great hit.</p>
	      <p>The crowd was relentless and enthusiastic.  One Jim Lewis from IBM Boca Raton was there.  He went home and told his boss Bob Lawton that they should consider this device for the L40SX computer.  We were invited to PC land again.  This time we were told that it would go into the product. Jim Lewis ran excellent experiments.  The Entry Systems Technology group was responsible for testing out new stuff.</p>
	      <p>They had a code name for the project, "Castaway", and that's what they tried to do.  To bolster confidence in our judgment, human factors experiments were run in Austin, Boca, Lexington and Yamato.  It was a circus.  I remember the way the PC division was- I would set up meetings with everyone, they would be 1 mile from each other in a pentagon-shaped building, we would run from Testani's to Condon's office, to Lawton's to Lewis' … no one joined each other's meetings so they could say different things and I would try to work on the constellation of comments  they made.   The people in Austin, Lexington and Boca seemed disorganized around our innovation.  As soon as the product was accepted by Toshiuki Ikeda of Yamato team, they asked me "Do we have to pay this ½ million to have EST do all these things?"  It could have cost the product - I looked at the list of things that had to be done to productize Castaway- only I and  Joe  and Bob Olyha knew how to do them and  most  were actually already completed….  	</p>
	      <p>"Please work with us," I said.   I was vocal and in the end I may have been the reason that the people causing friction for new technology in EST were disbanded the following year.  </p>
	      <p>The process of getting the pointing device into the Yamato project was the end of a lot of stories I won't enumerate here … more difficult demonstrations and meetings and pressure from the top IBM brass, more help from the bottom, more obstacles everywhere.   The distinguishing feature, however was the team approach to decisions and execution throughout the IBM Japan culture, a direct contrast to the processes we had encountered in the US IBM  PC groups in the early 1990s.</p>
	      <p>We went to Yamato, the first time I had been in Japan.  Ashok Chandra sat me down to help me integrate the data from seemly inconsistent experiments done at various labs in the world. The night before the presentation, we fit it together in its final form: the reason people had conflicting data was that the Yorktown experiments tested hours and weeks of use, Boca Raton measured 15 minutes of use and the Yamato data measured the first minute of   use of the new device.  Yamada-san stood up and gave a 45 minute talk about one cell on the learning curve matrix, the only one that showed the pointing stick being worse than a trackpad or trackball,for  the first 15 selections.  I got up and pointed out to everyone's amazement that while the Japanese's data was the most carefully taken and cleanest ever produced, it all represented a user's first experience only:  this was news to the Japan team.  Yamada had been working with Alps on a trackball that he was fond of.  Still, Yamada agreed with me to everyone's am	azement. Our work showing how the different experiments corresponded to different parts of a learning curve was the hit that mattered.  But then everyone agreed that the first few seconds of use might be the most important part of selling a product.  Unlike the American decision process, everyone in that meeting went to the next level up meeting and we were required (in an embarrassing show) to repeat our conflicting talks again.  This happened to an even larger crowd by afternoon including everyone that had been in the other two meetings. It included everyone agreeing to what had been said, allowing consensus.  Yamada had been encouraging us to introduce motion in our isometric joystick.  We had believed there was no space between keys for such motion.  We built one for him anyway that bent and brought it to Japan.  We had experimented with many shaped tops; we had convinced ourselves that a cup-shaped top (much like one that comes with a ThinkPad today but much smaller) would hold the finger with its edges	. Product manager and man with deep insight Ikeda and top engineer Arisama Naito both hated the way it felt- Ikeada pushed down hard and showed me how it left a dent in his finger. We had one week to fix the first experience problem and the feeling.  The fourth level manager Kasuaga-san stared me in the eye after we met with Mito the general manager of IBM Asia Pacific and got the go-ahead… he said now we put it in the product you must make it work.  It was one of the scariest moments ever.</p>
	      <p>We included Yamada as tour guide and judge.  We needed his interest and buy in to at least not be against anything besides the trackball.  He pushed us to do better work than we thought we could.  We went to Toyku Hands where I bought styrofoam, sandpaper, cork, sorbothane, rubber, etc.  We went to a ping pong shop- we went everywhere with me and my rechargeable dremel making Trackpoint tops… After several days and many dozen tops, we had a top that  was gooey enough to not slip, gooshed enough to hold the finger, and bent enough to give a novice proprioceptive feedback,,,,, that improved the first 15 selections by at least 15%, enough to match the pointing speed of a trackpad or trackball.  </p>
	      <p>This I hate to say was the beginning of a 9 month long list of tiny successes. Yamato assigned a Michio Suzuki  full time  to report to us the bugs he found with programs … and he found problems daily for months.  Bob Olyha worked on circuitry- improving everything about stability and calibration and many other things. </p>
	      <p>The rubber I specified, a 55 durometer post with a 145 mm top made of 1.5mm gushy stalks and a 1 mm low durometer latex top , did not make the IBM Rubber Center of Competence happy. They said it wasn't FDA approved… my father pointed out that condoms are made of latex …. He had worked at the Bureau of Standards on rubber design during "the War"-  I hired him to eliminate the plastic-filled-with-rubber top that would have killed the product; it was over Ikeda's dead body that I spent $20k on a tool to make my father's beautiful rubber top- the Portland company got screwed as we used the Japanese partner of  IBM to make the tops…the tops were not ready for production when the product shipped, I was adamant that the new tops were necessary… Within a week all the plastic tops in the field began breaking… they got slippery and then would require many times an ergonomically reasonable pressure to function… My father's tops were ready as the problem emerged in customers' hands. No one cared that they were expens	ive. While my father knew that the tops were going into product, he never got to see it as he died that week. </p>
	      <p>I challenged myself to cost reduce the device by one third each year and improve the product.  At first it was special needs buttons that were more comfortable and locked,  eliminating the long small signal kapton wires, integrating the post with the circuit board, inventing a new kind of A/D to eliminate a high noise chip, inventing more grippy tops that wore better and cost less, inventing a 3-D sensing  post, incorporating invention of "negative " inertia that I worked with Rob Barrett to create, integrating  work from multiple pointing stick experiments,  adding  and press to select- all made it better.  A mouse communication language allowed more control from the driver.  Better manufacturing processes and jigs simplified the product too.  An inplane joystick invention made the post more robust in several ways.   An integrated mechanical fuse that I worked with Barton Smith and Todd Wyant to create that reset automatically was fun to design too. Each of these features is a story in iteself.  Steve Ih	de put numerous improvements into the drivers all the time. All the  sticks ‘til recently shipped  with an algorithm that made it so a collaborator using another pointing device plugged into the keyboard would have conversational (1/3 second) pause needed to take the pointer away from the current driver of the UI.  This was hugely helpful for collaboration.  We shipped a teaching screen saver on OS/2 that showed how to use it and how to use the buttons.</p>
	      <p>The ones that got away are more poignant. I designed adaptive algorithms we were exploring- we were able to raise the tracking plateau by 50% for some people, and if we had had the go ahead we could have made that stable and increased performance tremendously.  It seems some people used tendon flex to improve pointing- we found this looked like overshoot and we had trouble making the adaptive algorithms stable in the time box we gave it.  We made a special application that was a game people played to improve their pointing –as their game play improved the transfer function improved  too!  We made a surgical tool that used a Trackpoint to allow tremor-free use of a camera from a laparoscope.  We made a selector for the FAA to do ground traffic control that saved a multihundred million dollar contract for IBM with the government.  I would have loved the product to change cursor movement approach for form filling, text editing and graphical applications; again that could probably double performance. Yes, I s	till want to do it NOW.  We built a gesture language into the Trackpoint that can be accessed in the firmware; the only aspect the driver exposes is Press to Magnify or Press to Select.  We created probably two dozen haptic feedback Trackpoint designs.  They improved novice performance and were loved by the special needs community.  I did a preliminary study that showed how novices selected faster with it; the product group saw no need to spend the money for that.  We made a science experimental test bed to teach physics that never shipped; we made many versions of multi-Trackpoint keyboards that never shipped.  We made many other things too- a versatile pointing device for the table called Russian tea mouse allowed for full hand, thumb, finger, or in-the-palm use.  We made pen like stalks that allowed selection without taking hands off the keyboard.  We made devices that used one set of sensors to run two input devices. We made an electormechanical design used by one special user.  We found that brushing th	e top instead of pressing it could give amazing dynamic range, at the expense of having to cycle the finger for long selections. The joystick for this had no deadband, it had an exquisite sensitivity and control … we never made an inkeyboard device that shipped with this alternative set of algorithms and scenario.  I designed better grippy top ideas that never made it; also better sensitivity solutions that never made it too.  And I hate to say it but there are many other improvements that I made or would like to make that I could elaborate further on but will stop here…..</p>

	      <p>The Pantograph is a 2 dimensional force-feedback device.  That is, it can be used to input 2D information into the computer, but it is also simultaneously a 2D tactile output device, or display.  It was developed in 1993 by Vincent Hayward and Christophe Ramstein.  The original motivation was to develop an input technology that would provide access to graphical user interfaces for people with visual disabilities. </p>
	      <p>In addition to the photo of the device that I have, Vincent Hayward has provided some images of other versions of the device which shed some light on how one explores the design space around a particular idea. </p>
	      <p>I really liked this device because of its innate simplicity – the design just had an elegance that appealed to me.  In describing the project, the developers write: </p>
	      <blockquote>Various versions have been used in the rehabilitation of visually handicapped persons, micro-gravity experiments, etc... The pantograph has one prominent characteristic: the surface which is being touched neither needs to be grasped not does it need to brace a finger (from an ecological view point, people very seldom use styluses or thimbles to explore objects. Using the pantograph resembles exploring surfaces though a small plate, which is closer to normality). Another feature is very high fidelity: irregularities in the frequency response start at 400Hz and it has 3 orders of magnitude of dynamic range. It has negligible friction and very low inertia which give the illusion (when no force signal is applied) of gliding over an icy surface.</blockquote>
	      <p>In writing to me about it, Vincent Hayward said: </p>
	      <blockquote>
	      <p>The Pantograph was, and still is, a fun project to work on. A most rewarding aspect is the spontaneous smiles consistently drawn from the occasional users. It's like as if something completely unexpected was happening. It is the case today like it was in 1993. There is an assumption that what we touch must be veridical, and that what we see or hear can be put in the box and can come out it. This is what made me become interested in touch.</p>
	      <p>The name was taken not so much because of the number of links and joints in the mechanism, but because a similar structure served as a basis for John Isaac Hawkins' "Polygraph", suggesting the idea of duplication. Another aspect that motivated me in pursuing this project for so long is the mechanical simplicity of the device compared to the amazing large number of interesting questions it raises. I think they will not be answered any time soon. </p>

 	        <p>This is one of those things that was just too strange not to try. It is a full QWERTY keyboard constructed out of flexible all silicone rubber. So, if you want a keyboard that you can roll up, this will do it.  If you want one that won’t care if you spill cola on it, no problem.  And, if you want one that you can carry around in your bag or briefcase without breaking, this will fit the bill.  You can even get it in all kinds of colours.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if you want a keyboard on which you can type, you might want to look elsewhere. </p>
	        <p>The challenge is, the flexibility applies to everything, including the keys, which are elevated as you would expect. The consequence is that the keys feel more like joysticks than keys.  Yes you can depress them.  But on the way down, they tend to bend in one direction or another.  Touch typing is kind of a disaster, and without the tactile snap of that accompanies a key depression, one is never sure if or when the key is actually fully depressed.</p>
	        <p>I can imagine places where this is a reasonable solution;  for example, where it is very wet.  But other than as a novelty, there are likely relatively few people for whom this is a good choice for keyboard entry.</p>
	        <p>An even more extreme expression of my impressions can be found in this closing line from a review in PC Pro by Tim Danton: </p>
	        <blockquote>"I beg of you, please don’t buy me this keyboard. Turns out that I would rather type on jelly.</blockquote>

	      <p>Maltron is an interesting British company, founded in 1977, that brought a radical and distinctive approach to a fairly established and standardized product:  keyboards.  The design was driven by two related factors:  a desire to combat RSI, coupled with some observations of the human hand.  The idea was that if the form of the keyboard better fit the shape of the hand, as they saw it, there would be less stress and therefore less RSI. </p>
	      <p>The aspect of the hand that they worked from is the curvature traced around the periphery of the fingers that can be observed when you look at the back of your hand with your fingers together.  The thought was that if they built the surface of the keyboard in the form of two concave bowls – one for each hand – the result would fit the hand much better than the traditional more-or-less flat traditional keyboard surface. </p>
	      <p>The "they" in the above was businessman, Stephen Hobday, who founded the company and is now chairman, and a keyboard training specialist from the local Technical College, Lillian Malt, after whom the keyboard and company were named. </p>
	      <p>I had known about the company from pretty early in its history, but had never used one.  At the same time, with my interest in chord keyboards – especially the Microwriter – and with Edgar Mathias and the development of his keyboard (also in the collection – I had developed an interest in one-handed keyboard design.  Hence, when I had the opportunity, I acquired this one-handed Maltron keyboard for the collection. </p>
	      <p>When it arrived, it showed every sign of having had heavy use over the years.  I started to clean it up, but then stopped.  It struck me that if I made it look pristine, it would lose some of its impact – the ability to tell its own story:  that not only could it be used, but it was used … heavily. </p>
	      <p>As Stephen Hobday wrote to me: </p>
	      <blockquote>… the single handed units were first made and offered as part of our range in 1989.  Since then there have been some changes to the design but essentially the concept is the same.  ….   At Stevenson College Edinburgh, one of the early users was a student who had only one hand.  She had endured many years of frustration but found that she quickly learned to key on her single handed keyboard, and subsequently got a Job ahead of some 50 other applicants. Many thousands of these keyboards have now been supplied to users in all parts of the world.</blockquote>
	      <p>Finally, I find PCD Maltron an interesting example of a particular kind of company – once that finds a balance between the tradition of specialized craftsmanship and the modern industrialized world.  There are a lot of companies represented in my collection, yet few of them have lasted, especially focusing on one basic thing.  Scale up and expand or disappear seems to be the dominant tendency.  It is good to have counter examples to remind us that there is more than one way to proceed. </p>

        <![CDATA[
      	<p>When the iMac G5 was released in August of 2004, I immediately noticed the tag line that Apple used in some of the marketing assets:</p>
      	<blockquote><i>From the creators of the iPod.</i></blockquote>
	      <p>It just leapt out at me – mainly because it spoke so loudly about the importance of adaptability and agility in successful  innovation.  Remember:  Apple was a company that had been selling  personal computers in volume since the launch of the Apple II in 1977.  That is, they had a 27 year history of being identified as a computer company – in both name and perception.  And yet, here was their latest computer not only adopting the design language of the iPod – in its colour, proportions and form – it was being promoted through its affinity to the upstart iPod, that only been on the market for 3 years, having been first introduced in October 2001. </p>
	      <p>To my reading, the slogan wasn't just an opportunistic means to promote the iMac G5 by associating it with their most recent hit product.  Rather, I see it - and saw it at the time - as something far more significant.  It was notice that Apple was no longer a computer company.  The change of the company name that was to follow, away from <i>Apple Computer</i>, was just a formality.  The actual change occurred with the release of this product and the use of this slogan.   </p>
	      <p>But how was Apple able to do this without creating trauma to its brand?  I think that the reason is that the core of Apple's brand was never actually "computer" in the first place.  Rather, it was something closer to "design", "appeal", "current", "quality of experience", "lifestyle", "aspiration" …  Words like that – or better.  </p>
	      <p>From that perspective, they didn't change their brand.  They just changed labels.  They knew the difference between the two, and to do that, they had to really understand their brand.  In fact, one could argue, had they kept their old label, Apple Computer, <i>then</i> they would have damaged their brand. </p>
	      <p>Jean Piaget defines intelligence in terms of an organism's ability to adapt to a change in the environment through the dual process of accommodation and assimilation.  In this way, this change by Apple simply demonstrated intelligent behaviour.  They recognized that things had changed, and it was time to shed some baggage – no matter how well it had served them over the previous 27 years. </p>
	      <p>There are at least a couple lessons in this.  One is, "Really know the essence of your brand".  The other is, "If you – or your employees – are not intimately familiar with the core of your brand value, how will you ever know if any action is on (or off) brand?"  </p>
	      <p>All of which is a long-way of saying, I had to have this poster.  It serves as a reminder of an important lesson, as well as an aid in telling the story.  Like now. </p>

	      <p>The RollerMouse Pro is a pretty interesting input device.  First developed in 2004, and the version that I have in 2005, its main purpose is to permit the normal functions of the mouse, such as pointing, scrolling, selection and dragging, while avoiding the need to move the hands away from the keyboard.</p>
	      <p>While several other technologies, such as touch pads, trackballs and miniature joysticks have been used to accomplish this, the RollerMouse Pro takes a fairly unique approach.  Like many of these devices, it is centrally located laterally relative to the QWERTY keyboard.  However, it is integrated into a  palm rest, such as you would and could add to a conventional keyboard – hence, it can be retro-fitted to many or most keyboards.</p>
	      <p>The heart of the device is a roller of about 4 cm diameter that is mounted horizontally parallel to the rows on the keyboard.  About 17 cm of the roller is exposed.  Rotating the roller moves the screen cursor up and down.  Sliding the roller left and right (there are about 9 cm total travel possible) moves the cursor horizontally.  The roller is surfaced in rubber, which means that it has good friction with the hand, and can be easily moved either horizontally, vertically, or both simultaneously in order to get diagonal motion. </p>
	      <p>One consequence of this design is that it is easy to use either hand for scrolling, thereby distributing the load.  Furthermore, there is a centrally mounted scroll-wheel below the bar which is positioned so as to be operated by either thumb, meaning that it is possible to operate with a different hand than that doing the pointing. </p>
	      <p>There are three large buttons, easily accessed by the thumb, mounted below the scroll wheel.  The left one serves as the left mouse button signal, something that can also be signaled by just pushing down on the roller bar.  The large central button is like an accelerator for double clicking – you get the signal through a single push.  </p>
	      <p>The large right-side button serves the normal function of the mouse right-button click, such as brining up a utility pop-up menu for cut, paste, copy, etc. </p>
	      <p>Finally, there are two smaller horizontally-mounted buttons between the roller-bar and the scroll wheel.  The left one locks the roller-bar into scroll mode so that you can use if for scrolling in lieu of the scroll wheel.  The other is used to anchor the selection point when you want to sweep out some text, for example.  The benefit here is that you do not need to keep your hand or finger in a state of tension holding down a button during the dragging process. </p>
	      <p>While both uncommon and largely unknown outside of those who are suffering from RSI, there is an interesting history to this class of device.  Back in the late 1980s, a designer named Craig Culver developed a roller-bar device which was called the <i>Isopoint</i>, and was built by Alps Electric.  Besides being yet another example of how such ideas evolve, the historically point of interest is that the Isopoint roller device was used on the very first PC laptop to have an integrated pointing device that was mounted front and center of the keyboard (the <i>GRiDCASE 1550sx</i>, introduced in November 1989).  As with the RollerMouse Pro, this made it possible for both right and left-hand users to operate (something that virtually all laptops enable today).</p>
	      <p>There is at least one other device that uses the Isopoint-type roller-bar.  It made in Sweden and is known as the Nomus Navigator: </p>

	      <p>The first digital camera that I used was the Apple Quicktake 100, which was released in 1994.  I have no idea where that camera ended up.  My second digital camera was this one, my Nikon Coolpix 100.  This was released in 1997, and I got it as soon as it came out.  While not as high resolution as the Quicktake 100 (512 x 480 vs 640 x 480), the convenience, size and simplicity of the camera really appealed to me – and in many ways, still does.</p>
	      <p>One of the main reasons is that it is self-contained.  It is the only digital camera that I have had for which I didn't have to carry around extra cables to connect it to my computer, or power supplied with which to recharge the batteries.  While not small by today's standards, it nevertheless  fit in my briefcase or pocket and was there to use.  And, because it had an integrated PCMCIA card, one just slid it into the card slot on one's computer and the images were immediately accessible.  In so doing, it introduced many of the characteristics that made the more recent ill-fated Flip video camera so appealing.</p>
	      <p>Yes, it only had .3 megapixel images, and had no zoom, no LCD to review images taken, was expensive, and only held 19 full-resolution images.  But it was also 1997.  It was great for the time – and given that my briefcase today has more than 4 times this camera's volume in cables and power supplies for the various gadgets that I "must have" with me to do my job, I wish that some of the attributes of this camera (cables and power supplies) were more prevalent today!</p>
	      <p>Excerpt from a Review PC Pro magazine, October 1997</p>

	      <p>Leaving aside the vagaries of PC Card, the Nikon CoolPix couldn't be much easier to use, both to take pictures and to get them into your PC (provided you have a PC Card). As with all cameras in this price range, the resolution means any images printed in sizes much above 5 « 3in are going to show their digital origins. Some compression artefacts are visible, as is the dither pattern, but for newsletters and Web sites the Nikon provides good results with excellent build quality and ease of use, all at a good price. </p>
	      <p>Nikon is marketing the CoolPix as a computer peripheral and not as a camera. Image quality for holiday snapshot-size prints won't match a half-decent compact camera at a fraction of the cost.

        <![CDATA[
	      <p>I have this computer in my collection as a reminder of the delicate relationship between object and purpose, and how no matter how well one does on the former, it will likely have no impact on making a wanting concept any better.   I include it in this exhibition as a cautionary tale of how the object may help sell that concept, regardless how ill-conceived.  This product is here to provide a reminder to keep a critical mind and questioning discourse, regardless of how seductive the technology, or how well intentioned the concept.  The concept may be broken, nevertheless. </p>
	      <p>From the perspective of hardware and software, one has to be impressed by much of what the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project was able to accomplish.  In general, the team delivered a computer that could be produced at a remarkably low price – even if about double that which was targeted.  Specifically, the display, for example, is innovative, and stands out due to its ability to work both in the bright sun (reflective) as well as in poorly lit spaces (emissive) – something that goes beyond pretty much anything else that is available on today’s slate computers or e-readers.  In short, some excellent work went into this machine, and that is all the more impressive, given the nature of the organization. </p>
	      <p>Ultimately, however, the machine was a means to an end, not the end itself.  Rather, the actual mission of the OLPC project was: </p>
	      <blockquote>… to empower the world's poorest children through education.<sup> </sup> </blockquote>
	      <p>As described by in their materials, the computer was intended to play a key role in this: </p>
	      <blockquote>With access to this type of tool, children are engaged in their own education, and learn, share, and create together. They become connected to each other, to the world and to a brighter future.<sup> </sup></blockquote>
	      <p>Hence, making a suitable computer suitable to that purpose and the conditions where it would be used, at a price point that would enable broad distribution, was a key part of the project. </p>
	      <p><b>The Underlying Belief System of the OLPC Project</b></p>
	      <p>Since they are key to the thinking behind the OLPC project, I believe if fair to frame my discussion around the following four questions: </p>
	      <ol>
	      <li>Will giving computers to kids in the developing world improve their education?</li>
	      <li>Will having a thus better educated youth help bring a society out of poverty? </li>
	      <li>Can that educational improvement be accomplished by giving the computers to the kids, with no special training for teachers? </li>
	      <li>Should this be attempted on a global scale without any advance field trials or pilot studies? </li> 
	      </ol>
	      <p>From the perspective of the OLPC project, the answer to every one of these question is an unequivocal "yes".  In fact, as we shall see, any suggestion to the contrary is typically answered by condescension and/or mockery.  The answers appear to be viewed as self-evident and not worth even questioning.  </p>
	      <p>Others might call that hubris. </p>
	      <p>What staggers me is how the project has gotten this far as it has without the basic assumptions being more broadly questioned and such questions being seriously answered.  How did seemingly otherwise people commit to the project, through their labour or financial investment, given the apparently naïve and utopian approach that it took?  Does the desire to do good cloud judgment that much?  Are we that dazzled by a cool technology or big hairy audacious goal?  Or by a charismatic personality?<sup> </sup> </p>
	      <p>To explain my concern, and what this artifact represents to me, let me just touch on the four assumptions on which the project was founded. </p>
	      <p><b>Will giving computers to kids in the developing world improve education?</b></p>
	      <p>The literature on this question is, at best, mixed.  What is clear is that one cannot make any assumption that such improvements will occur, regardless of whether one is talking about the developing world or suburban USA.  For example, in January 2011, The World Bank published the following study: </p>
	      <blockquote>Can Computers Help Students Learn?  From Evidence to Policy, January, 2011, Number 4, The World Bank. <sup> </sup></blockquote>
	      <ul>
	      <li>A public-private partnership in Colombia, called Computers for Education, was created in 2002 to increase the availability of computers in public schools for use in education.</li>
	      <li>Since starting, the program has installed more than 73,000 computers in over 6,300 public schools in more than 1,000 municipalities. By 2008, over 2 million students and 83,000 teachers had taken part. </li>
	      <li>This document reports on a two-year study to determine the impact of the program on student performance. </li>
	      <li>Students in schools that received the computers and teacher training did not do measurably better on tests than students in the control group. Nor was there a positive effect on other measures of learning. </li>
	      <li>Researchers did not find any difference in test scores when they looked at specific components of math and language studies, such as algebra and geometry, and grammar and paraphrase ability in Spanish. </li>
	      <li>But report also notes that results of such studies are mixed:<br /><br />
	      Studies on the relationship between using computers in the classroom and improved test scores in developing countries give mixed results: A review of Israel’s Tomorrow-98 program in the mid-1990s, which put computers in schools across the country, did not find any impact on math and Hebrew language scores<sup> </sup>. But in India, a study of a computer-assisted learning program showed a significant positive impact on math scores<sup> </sup>. One thing researchers agree on, more work is needed in this field. </li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>Before moving on, a search of the literature will show that these results are consistent with those that were available in the literature at the time that the project was started.  The point that I am making is not that the OLPC project could not be made to work;  rather, that it was simply wrong to assume that it would without spending far more time designing the process to bring that about, than designing a computer.  Risk is fine, and something that can be mitigated.  But diving in, assuming that it would just work is not calculated risk, it is gambling - with other people’s lives, education and money. </p>
	      <p><b>By having a thus better educated population, will it help bring that society out of poverty?</b></p>
	      <p>I am largely going to punt on this question.  The fact is, I would be hard pressed to argue against education.  </p>
	      <p>But let us grant that improving education in the developing world is a good thing.  The appropriate question is then:  is the approach of the OLPC project a reasonable or responsible way to disburse the limited resources that are available to address the problem? </p>
	      <p>At the very least, I would suggest that this is a topic worthy of debate.  Just assuming that giving computers is the right solution is akin to the, "If you build it they will come" approach seen in the movie, Field of Dreams.  </p>
	      <p>But that was a movie.  These are real lives that are at stake here – lives of those who cannot afford to see the movie, much less have precious resources spent on projects that are not well thought through. </p>
	      <p><b>Can that improvement be accomplished by just giving the computers to the kids without training teachers?</b></p>
	      <p>Remarkably, the OLPC Project’s answer is an explicit, "Yes".  </p>
	      <p>In a TED talk filmed in December 2007, the founder of the OLPC initiative, Nicholas Negroponte states<sup> </sup>:</p>
	      <blockquote><i>"When people tell me, you know, who’s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids, I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"  Okay, there’s not a person in this room [the TED Conference], I don’t care how techy you are, there’s not a person in this room that doesn’t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it.  Okay, we all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned."</i></blockquote>
	      <p>Of course, the failure of this logic is that it misses that point that those unseasoned kids are part of "us", as in "we all need help".  So, where do the kids go for help?  To other kids?  What if they don’t know?  Often they won’t.  What then? </p>
	      <p>No answer is offered.  Rather, those who dare raise the serious and legitimate concern of teacher education are mockingly dismissed as coming from another planet! 
	      <p>Well, perhaps they are.  But in that case, there should at least be some debate as to who lives on what planet.  Is it the people raising the question or the one dismissing the concern, that lives in the real world of responsible thought and action?   </p>
	      <p><b>Can this all be accomplished without any advance field trials?  Should one just immediately commit to international deployment of the program?</b></p>
	      <p>As recently as September 2009, Negroponte took part in a panel discussion where he spoke on this matter.<sup> </sup> He states: </p>
	      <blockquote><i><p>I'd like you to imagine that I told you "I have a technology that is going to change the quality of life." And then I tell you "Really the right thing to do is to set up a pilot project to test my technology. And then the second thing to do is, once the pilot has been running for some period of time, is to go and measure very carefully the benefits of that technology."</p>
	      <p>And then I am to tell you that what we are going to is very scientifically evaluate this technology, with control groups - giving it to some, giving it to others. And this all is very reasonable until I tell you the technology is electricity.  And you say "Wait, you don't have to do that!"</p>
	      <p>But you don't have to do that with laptops and learning either. And the fact that somebody in the room would say the impact is unclear is to me amazing - unbelievably amazing. There's not a person in this room who hasn't bought a laptop for their child, if they could afford it. And you don't know somebody who hasn't done it, if they can afford it.</p>
	      <p>So there's only one question on the table and that's, "How to afford it?" That's the only question. There is no other question - it's just the economics. And so, when One Laptop Per Child started, I didn't have the picture quite as clear as that, but we did focus on trying to get the price down. We did focus on those things.</p></i></blockquote>
	      <p>Unfortunately, Negroponte demonstrates his lack of understanding of both the history of electricity and education in this example.  His historical mistake is this:  yes, it was pretty obvious that electricity could bring many benefits to society.  On the other hand, completely sure that he was right, and that DC was the way to go, Edison leapt prematurely into a very expensive mistake. </p>
	      <p>By analogy, yes, it is pretty obvious that education could bring significant benefits to the developing world.  But in order to avoid making the same kind of expensive mistake that Edison did, perhaps one might want to do one’s best to make sure that the OLPC concept was not the DC of education. </p>
	      <p>A little more research, and a little less confidence in one’s own opinion might have saved those who invested in both Edison’s and the OLPC project’s rush to deployment a great deal.  </p>
	      <p>The underlying question is this:  in what way is it responsible for the wealthy western world to advocate an untested and expensive (in every sense) technological solution on the most poor nations in the world? </p>
	      <p>If history has taught us anything, it has taught us that just because our intentions are good, the same is not necessarily true for our consequent actions.<sup> </sup> </p>
	      <p>Later on in his presentation, Negroponte states</p>
	      <blockquote>… our problems are swimming against very na&#239;ve views of education.</blockquote>
	      <p>With this, I have to agree.  It is just whose views on education are na&#239;ve, and how can such views emerge from MIT, no less, much less pass with so little critical scrutiny by the public, the press, participants, and funders?  </p>
	      <p>In an interview with Paul Marks, published in the New Scientist in December 2008,<sup> </sup> we see the how the technocentric aspect of the project plays into the ostensible humancentric purpose of the project.  Negroponte’s retort regarding some of the initial skepticism that the project provoked was this: </p>
	      <blockquote><p>"When we first said we could build a laptop for $100 it was viewed as unrealistic and so 'anti-market' and so 'anti' the current laptops which at the time were around $1000 each," Negroponte said.</p>
	      <p>"It was viewed as pure bravado - but look what happened: the netbook market has developed in our wake." The project's demands for cheaper components such as keyboards, and processors nudged the industry into finding ways to cut costs, he says. "What started off as a revolution became a culture."</p></blockquote>
	      <p>Surprise, yes, computers get smaller, faster and cheaper over the course of time, and yes, one can even grant that the OLPC project may have accelerated that inevitable move.  </p>
	      <p>But in the context of the OLPC project, one might well ask, "So what?"  Yes it is obviously necessary to have computers in the first place, before one can introduce them into the classroom, home, and donate them to children in the developing world.  </p>
	      <p>But is not success in this regard just meeting a prerequisite? The meaningful metric of isn’t the <i>raison d’&#234;tre</i> of the initiative, and only metric of success which one can claim vindication from the skeptics, the impact that those computers have on education? </p>
	      <p>Rather, the absence of such an educational basis, and the reliance on the technocentric one, speaks loudly in terms of  what is at the front of the mind. </p>
	      <p>But perhaps the extent of the nature and extent of the utopian dream is captured in the last part of the interview: </p>
	      <blockquote><p>Negroponte believes that empowering children and their parents with the educational resources offered by computers and the internet will lead to informed decisions that improve democracy.</p>
	      <p>Indeed, it has led to some gentle ribbing between himself and his brother: John Negroponte - currently deputy secretary of state in the outgoing Bush administration and the first ever director of national intelligence at the National Security Agency.</p>
	      <p>"I often joke with John that he can bring democracy his way - and I'll bring it mine," he says.</p></blockquote>
	      <p>So, apparently providing inexpensive laptops to children in the developing world is not only going to raise educational standards, eradicate poverty, it is also going to bring democracy!  All that, with no mention of the numerous poor non-democratic countries that have literacy levels equal to or higher than the USA (Cuba might be one reasonable example).  The words naïve technological-utopianism come to mind, which lead me to the last article that I want to mention. </p>
	      <p>I began by admitting that I was conflicted in terms of this project.  Yes, as both a designer and computer scientist, there is a lot about what the project accomplished impressive from the purely technological perspective.  But what I find worrying is the apparent inability to distinguish between the technology and the non-technological.</p>
	      <p>This is shared by a paper published in late 2010 in the Journal of International Affairs, by Warschauer &amp; Ames<sup> </sup>.  What they write is this: </p>
	      <blockquote><i>The analysis reveals that provision of individual laptops is a utopian vision for the children in the poorest countries, whose educational and social futures could be more effectively improved if the same investments were instead made on more sustainable and proven interventions. Middle- and high-income countries may have a stronger rationale for providing individual laptops to children, but will still want to eschew OLPC’s technocentric vision. In summary, OLPC represents the latest in a long line of technologically utopian development schemes that have unsuccessfully attempted to solve complex social problems with overly simplistic solutions.</i></blockquote>
	      <p>As I said at the start, I have this computer in my collection as a constant reminder of the delicate relationship between technology and society, culture, ethics and values.   The fact that this project got the support that it did, and has gone as far as it has, given the way it was approached, says that such reminder is necessary.  And if anyone ever wonders why I am so vocal about the level of public discourse around technology, one need look no further than the OLPC project. </p>

        <![CDATA[
	      <p>The Rockin' Mouse was one of those things that one had to try.  It was a project done in our research group at the 3D graphics software company, Alias|Wavefront, in 1996.  It was done by my colleagues, Ravin Balakrishnan, Thomas Baudel, Gord Kurtenbach, and George Fitzmaurice. </p>
	      <p>We were working in 3D graphics, so were interested in exploring novel ways that might extend the number of degrees of freedom that we could control with a mouse, without degrading its performance in conventional tasks.  We were also pretty aware of other work that had gone on in this direction, such as Venolia's  pioneering 1989 work at Apple, making the first scroll-wheel mouse. </p>
	      <p>The idea that Ravin, Thomas, Gord and George pursued – I was not personally involved in the project, other than being the group head of the lab – was to modify what appeared as conventional mouse, by making the bottom concave.  Thus, one could move it and work the buttons like a normal mouse, but also rock it left-right and/or forward-backward, thereby gaining access to two additional degrees of freedom.  In reality, the way that the mouse was actually implemented was to mount position and tilt sensors from a Wacom tablet stylus/cursor into the device, and then use the tablet as a mouse pad.  It was still a relative controller, just with less conventional sensors.   In some ways, the effect was making the mouse body itself into a kind of joystick. </p>
	      <p>During the project, the team explored different form factors for the mouse before landing on the one shown here and used in the study.  Notably, in light of my earlier comment, one of them was in the form of a movable joystick. </p>
	      <p>In the study, they had subjects move an object from one location to a target position in 3D space.  They compared the new mouse's performance to that of a traditional mouse.  The results were positive, enough to suggest that the idea was worth further exploration – exploration that never really happened.  This, in itself, is worth pointing out, as it is something that frequently happens in research, where there is always a kind of triage that needs to be undertaken to decide which, of all of the things that one might pursue, you actually allocate the resources to do so.  The key thing here is that the field is full of such ideas, not abandoned because they were necessarily bad ideas;  rather, because there were other things deemed to be of higher priority to do. </p>
	      <p>This is one of the reasons that innovation and invention need to look back, as well as forward, since a knowledge of the literature, i.e., classic scholarship, may well point the way to innovative and relevant solutions for today's and tomorrow's problems.  For example, if I were to revive the Rockin' mouse, the first study that I would do would be to see how well it worked simply to integrate pointing and scrolling.  Instead of a scroll-wheel (which only scrolls in 1 dimension, normally vertically, one could just rock the mouse in the direction you want a document – such as a spreadsheet - to scroll, and it would do so at a rate proportional to the amount of tilt.  I would then compare that to existing 2DOF scrolling techniques such as touch pads, joysticks or trackballs, which have been mounted on top of mice. </p>
	      <p>The deeper one goes, the more questions, and the more interesting questions, one encounters! </p>

        <![CDATA[
	      <p>The No-Hands Mouse consists of two foot pedals, one of which is an alternative to the left and right mouse buttons, and the other is actually a foot-operated joystick cursor control.  Together, they offer a hands-free replacement for the mouse.</p>
	      <p>The pedal that is the button replacement sends a left-mouse-click signal when clicked towards the toe, and right mouse button when clicked towards the heel.</p>
	      <p>As already mentioned, the cursor control pedal is used as an x/y rate controlled joystick, with direction determined by the direction the pedal is tilted, and the speed by the amount of pressure in that direction, which determines the amount to the tilt.</p>
	      <p>While generally slower than a hand-operated by a mouse, these controllers have value in cases where the hands are needed for some other task, or in cases where the hands cannot be used, such as due to injury.  And, while pointing time may be slower, the device acquisition time is not, when compared cases where the hand must move from the keyboard to the mouse.  The reason is that the feet can already be in "home position" for the pedals. Doing so, however, means that the feet need to stay in one position. So, while the pedals may relieve one problem with the hands, they may open up the possibility of introducing a new one with the feet.</p>
	      <p>The lesson to take from this is that high levels of repetition of anything will eventually cause stress issues.  Good posture can reduce the rate of incidence.  But the best thing to do, if able, is to always vary it up – reduce stress and reduce repetition.</p>

	      <p>This is a pretty amazing device that was released by Sony in 1996 (only in Japan). At first glance, it has a lot in common with later Tablet-PCs.  In fact, it uses the same Wacom pen technology as the majority of tablet PCs today.</p>
	      <p>What made it very unusual was that there was a button on the side that pops out a slot along the base of the device, below the screen, where you can feed a sheet of paper.  It is the paper feed for a built-in scanner.  You run up to an 8 ½ x 11 sheet of paper through, and bingo, it appears on the screen where you can read it, email it, or annotate it with the pen.  This integration of capabilities, coupled with extraordinary industrial design for the time, represents a very strong effort to bridge between the physical and digital worlds.</p>

It was designed to allow the user to interact with that PC's applications from a distance over a wireless network.  What made it interesting to me was that it let one do so directly on the CruisePAD's screen, using either a stylus or finger. </p> 
	      <p>This was an interesting approach given when it was released.  In that year, 1995, neither Wi-Fi (which came into existence in 1999 with the formation of the Wi-Fi Alliance), nor the IEEE 802.11 protocols on which it was based, were available (the original version of the IEEE 802.11 standard was not released until 1997).  Hence, it relied upon a proprietary 2.4 Ghz spread-spectrum radio protocol which they called CruiseLAN.</p>  
	      <p>The PCMCIA card that you see beside the CruisePAD is what is plugged into the host computer in able for the two to communicate.</p>

	      <p>While not a chess player, I was certainly aware of the game (my father played) and the various electronic/computer chess sets that started to appear with the advent of consumer digital electronics.  But this one – the Phantom, Model 6100, released by Fidelity International in 1988 - was different, and despite not playing the game, I had to have it.  </p>
	      <p>The reason was that it did something different than the others, and was an example of something that I thought was very important:  an almost transparent blend between the physical and the virtual worlds.  This was around the time, circa 1993-94, that George Fitzmaurice, myself, and later Hiroshi Ishii, were beginning to look into what became known as "graspable" or "tangible" user interfaces.  By its integration of the physical and virtual, this game exemplified exactly the kind of attributes that we were trying to achieve.  In short, it was a wonderful reference object that helped set the bar, and remind us what we were about. </p>
	      <p>For the human player, this game was pretty much like any other.  In fact, if two people wanted to play, it was exactly like any other.   You just set the pieces on the board and got down to it.  On the other hand, if you were alone, but still wanted an advisory to test your game against, you also just set up the pieces, but this time you only did two things differently.  First, you turned the computer on.  Second, when you made a move, you had to slightly push the piece down on the board. </p>
	      <p>What then transpired was then almost magic.  You played your game your way, and the computer played its own game, but did so by moving the same pieces as a human opponent would have.  The way it did so was invisible.   Within the chess board, below the surface, was a robot arm with a magnet on the end.  Likewise, each piece also had a magnet on the bottom.  While the actual pieces were indistinguishable from each other to the computer, that didn't matter.  It knew the starting positions for chess, so then only needed to keep track of each throughout the game.  Hence, it would just pace the arm under the piece it wanted to move, magnetically "grab" the piece, and slide it to the desired collection.  And, since it knew where all the pieces were, it would temporarily move any pieces blocking tis path out of its way during the move. </p>
	      <p>To do this, however, it needed to know where the human's pieces were.  This explains why the human had to push their pieces into the board when making a move.  Just think of each square on the board, as well as the border around it, as being a pressure-sensitive switch.  Pushing down at the start of the move could then inform the computer which piece you were moving.  Pushing down on placing a piece, let it know where its new position was. </p>
	      <p>The most uncanny experience in all of this resulted when you had the computer play itself.  It is simply a very different experience to see a computer playing itself using physical chess pieces, compared to a virtual chess board on a computer screen. </p>
	      <p>The first version of the Phantom Chess Computer was released in 1983 by Milton Bradley, now part of Hasbro.  When they stopped production, the product was picked up by Fidelity International, who released a slightly modified version, the one that I have.  A version of the product is still on the market, called the Phantom Force, available from ExcaLibur Electronics. </p>

	      <p>This is an extreme case of what I call a "super appliance", or multi-function device.  The heart of it is a 5" black-and-white portable television.  But that does not even begin to tell the whole story.  Here is a list of what it includes: </p>
	      <ol>
	      <li><b>Television:</b>  5" black-and-white TV with VHF/UHF bands</li>
	      <li><b>Radio: </b> with Weather Channel and AM & FM bands</li>
	      <li><b>Siren: </b>  acoustic</li>
	      <li><b>Lights: </b> </li>
	      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	      <li>Flashing Red Emergency Light</li>
	      <li>"Torch" style flash light</li>
	      <li>Fluorescent Lamp for general illumination</li>
	      </ol>
	      <li><b>Thermometer</b></li>
	      <li><b>Clock</b></li>
	      <li><b>Compass</b></li>
	      <li><b>Ultra-Sonic Mosquito Repeller</b></li>
	      </ol>
	      <p>So that you can use this device in a range of circumstances, it can be powered by batteries (9 D-cells), from an automobile cigarette lighter receptacle, or from your regular home wall-plug. </p>
	      <p>Given the inclusion of the emergency lights and siren, and its ability to be used un-tethered due to the option of battery power, one might imagine that the device is designed to be used in emergency situations, such as in a storm, for example.  One might be forgiven, therefore, if one is a bit taken aback by the cautions in the manual about using the device in the rain, extreme heat, or its fragility: </p>
	      <img src="a/m/Jeep%20002.png"/>
	      <p>Of course, the value of all of these emergency functions hangs on whether or not you have the device with you at the time of the emergency.  Given its size and weight, I suspect that unless you travel in a very large motor-home, you will not have room for it. </p>
	      <p>This device caught my eye the minute that it was released.  It was so over the top, I had to get one.  I have no idea who it was designed for (other than collectors of bizarre products like me), or why Jeep – a company known for making rugged outdoor products – would want to associate their brand with such a product.  </p>
	      <p>When I got it, I was even more surprised (delighted?) by how bad it was.  In addition to having so many functions that it was essentially useless, you could pretty much only use one of the electronic functions at a time.  For example, you can’t have a light on while listening to the radio or watching TV.  Fantastic! </p>
	      <p>Given how many potentially great products I have seen that never made it into production, I am still amazed by some of the products that do.  There is an important lesson in this:  a great idea is not enough to carry a product to market.   There are other factors at play that the designer and innovator must take into account.  Furthermore, these other factors may very well trump a good idea. </p>
	      <p>Successful design must take the whole deal into account! </p>

      <Description>This is the device that really changed the hand-held PDA market. While the minimal functionality and clear purpose were important to its success, other devices also had those attributes. What is neglected is recognition of the importance of HotSync, which was the key differentiator. HotSync enables you to copy your contents in less than a minute by pushing one button. By using the same technique, you can get up and running quickly by copying your address book and calendar from your computer to the device, rather than by hand entering everything.</Description>

      <Description>This keyboard comes in all kinds of colours. It won't break when you drop it, or short circuit if you spill liquid on it. All good. The only problem is that pressing a key is like pushing wet string. While designing all of its attributes, the designers forgot the most important one: You have to be able to type.</Description>
      <LongDescription>
        <![CDATA[
 	<p>This is one of those things that was just too strange not to try. It is a full QWERTY keyboard constructed out of flexible all silicone rubber. So, if you want a keyboard that you can roll up, this will do it.  If you want one that won’t care if you spill cola on it, no problem.  And, if you want one that you can carry around in your bag or briefcase without breaking, this will fit the bill.  You can even get it in all kinds of colours.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you want a keyboard on which you can type, you might want to look elsewhere. </p>
	<p>The challenge is, the flexibility applies to everything, including the keys, which are elevated as you would expect. The consequence is that the keys feel more like joysticks than keys.  Yes you can depress them.  But on the way down, they tend to bend in one direction or another.  Touch typing is kind of a disaster, and without the tactile snap of that accompanies a key depression, one is never sure if or when the key is actually fully depressed.</p>
	<p>I can imagine places where this is a reasonable solution;  for example, where it is very wet.  But other than as a novelty, there are likely relatively few people for whom this is a good choice for keyboard entry.</p>
	<p>An even more extreme expression of my impressions can be found in this closing line from a review in PC Pro by Tim Danton: </p>
	<blockquote>"I beg of you, please don’t buy me this keyboard. Turns out that I would rather type on jelly.</blockquote>

      <Description>This keyboard works by having each of your ten fingers choosing the character you want by selecting from a radial menu. You can push down, or move north, south, east or west, and get a different character for each. The character you get corresponds pretty well to the character you get with the same finger when you move it from home position on a conventional QWERTY keyboard. The idea is to reduce arm fatigue.</Description>

      <Description>This keyboard is a bizarre design. The touch pad is on the bottom of the keyboard and oriented so that you can't just flip the keyboard in a simple way to use it. Having a large touchpad on the bottom can be a great benefit—if done correctly. This implementation challenges my mantra, "everything is best for something and worst for something else." I need to think about the first part for a while!</Description>

      <Description>Sometimes seemingly crazy ideas work. Edgar Matias came to my group with the strange notion to make a half-sized keyboard with full-sized keys by sawing a keyboard in half, and typing with one hand. But activating a special mode key, the other side of the keyboard would just map, mirror image, onto the existing half. It turns out that it works, and that touch typists can adapt to it rather quickly.</Description>

A good reminder. Without appropriate references, we tend to set the bar far too low.</Description>

      <Description>It is funny that on the one hand, some people who know better say, "if it has a stylus, they blew it" (it meaning the design), and on the other, we are starting to see all kinds of styli emerging for capacitive touch screens. This is a beautiful hand-crafted brush in a Japanese style made for the iPad. I would never have predicted this one, but I find it very interesting. Something is going on here, and my sense is that the domination of touch is about to be balanced by a renewed interest in properly supporting pen input.</Description>

      <Description>In Canada, this mouse is known as the Apple "hockey puck mouse." It came with the original iMac and it was a disaster. Being round, there were no cues as to the orientation in which you were holding it. So, you might move your hand up, and see the cursor go off to the side. It was quickly replaced. I keep one hanging by my desk, just to remind me that we are all fallible, no matter how good we, or others, think we are.</Description>

Their success in selling this mouse is what caused Logitech to switch from a software development shop to one of the world's leading suppliers of mice and other input devices.</Description>

      <Description>The major change in this generation of the TrackPoint Mouse was changing the nipple-type tip of the TrackPoint for a kind of indented rocker. The fingers are not good at exerting lateral forces, but they are good at downward force. By going out to the edge of the rocker and pushing down, one applied a force in that direction by using leverage. Much better ergonomics.</Description>

It is useful for editing temporal media; less useful for word processing.</Description>

      <Description>This mouse takes a page out of "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home," where Scotty picks up a Macintosh mouse, thinking it is a microphone, and speaks into it. Well, it works on this one, as long as you are calling a person and not trying to speak to the computer. It has a regular phone embedded in the mouse, the dial keypad on the back, and a second cable that just plugs into the phone jack on your wall. A seemingly quaint idea at the time. Yet, with the popularity of voice over IP, this quaint idea is starting to come back and get some traction. Perhaps timing isn't everything. But it is something that is often the difference between goose and hero. </Description>

      <Description>In this industry, it seems fine to call anything that moves a cursor, or even tries to do so, a mouse. Not a practice to be encouraged. In this case, the mouse is a pair of petals: one is a foot-operated rocker switch for mouse button signals, and the other is a foot-operated, spring-loaded, self-returning joystick. These are slower to operate than a handheld device, and they limit your ability to change your posture during long sessions. However, if your arms are incapacitated, it is sure better than a lot of other options.</Description>

      <Description>This digital clipboard lets you write on regular paper with pen and ink, and yet everything is captured digitally. The clipboard is a graphics tablet with an embedded microprocessor, power, and memory. The pen is a digitizing stylus that also has a conventional ink cartridge. There were two problems with this device. First, the pen was terrible—surprising since Cross is a pen company. The problem was that it had a lot of tip-travel that made if feel terribly spongy. The other problem was that the digital version had no idea if or when you had flipped pages on the paper copy. Hence, things could get out of sync. There were other issues. But it was close to being good.</Description>

      <Description>This device was almost a good computer. It was probably too early to do what it was trying to do satisfactorily. But my sense was that the team who built it were not using it while they built it, and therefore did not appreciate the consequences of some of the decisions made. Communications were one of its supposed strong points, but even today we have problems logging in with pen-based systems unless the implementation is perfect. It showed great promise, and it was really informative to use as it evolved. However, in retrospect, trying to do less better may well have been a better tactic. Easy to say now, hard at the time. Drawing lines on paper is almost always easier than drawing lines in the sand of projects.</Description>

      <Description>This device captures what is written on regular paper by using a special pen, but does so with a well thought-out wrinkle. The base unit that clips on the end of the paper is a USB memory stick, augmented with a microprocessor, software, and pen sensors. It needs no cables. When you are near your computer, you just plug it in to the USB port and transfer your notes the same way you would from any other memory stick. And, if you leave the device plugged in, the battery will charge.</Description>

      <Description>This system uses technology developed by a Swedish company, Anoto, to capture what is written with ink on paper. To avoid the problems of the CrossPad, special paper with embedded glyphs is required. These glyphs are near invisible to the human eye, but they encode their own location on the page, as well as the page itself, and do so in a way that can be seen by a miniature camera embedded in the stylus. Hence, registration between the physical and digital ink is pretty much ensured. The only real penalties are the need for special paper and for a pen that is fatter than one would use otherwise.</Description>

      <Description>The Momenta was a system that was generating a lot of excitement. As with the Active Book, a lot of the UI was done in Smalltalk, and it may have been the first commercial system to use radial (or pie) menus. We got a development system at the University of Toronto, but the company went broke very soon after shipping, so we never got the final product. They are extremely rare, so it took me a long time to find this one. Could the company have survived? Impossible to say. What I find interesting was how different their industrial design was than anyone else's. Perhaps they tried too hard and got over extended. The resulting hardware was a bit to fiddly for my taste—but that is through today's eyes. The founder has written a fair bit about the experience, and I believe that the case studies are worth reading by would-be entrepreneurs.</Description>

      <Description>I treasure this device because it has some wonderful industrial design. The key thing is the way that a paper sheet scanner is integrated into the bottom of the bezel of the screen. Hence, you can pull a sheet of paper through and see an image of its contents on the screen. One can then mark on it, or work on it, by using the Wacom stylus and digitizer that are integrated into the screen. This was only available in Japan.</Description>

Try drawing a square with the joystick without using the template.</Description>

      <Description>This remote control is from the days when television was starting to take a solid grip. It is a reminder of the importance of transaction cost. Every button on the remote was already on the TV. So why spend extra money for features that you already had? The reason is that if the new redundant approach lowers the cost differential of usage enough, they are no longer the same features. They will be used differently and change the nature of both the beast and the experience. Not only did the remote save us from getting out of our comfortable chair, it thereby resulted in a change in the very nature of television: programming, script writing, cinemaphotography, editing, and the whole economic model in terms of commercials. Not bad for a few redundant buttons!</Description>

      <Description>This device is one of the early examples that I encountered of tangible computing and phycons being used in industry. When BMW was designing the new Mini, they had a light-table type of tablet surface on which they put these models. By moving the position and angle of the phycon, or proxie, the full-size virtual model being projected on the power wall moved accordingly. It was a kind of worlds in miniature approach. This is one of the cars.</Description>

      <Description>When screens were small and expensive, screen real estate was too valuable to waste on UI elements, especially if they were used all the time. Hence, the practice was often to sacrifice some of the tablet surface, and allocate it as an extension of the display—in this case, for menus. The display, of course, is not dynamic, but the menu items were more-or-less persistently needed. Hence, only a quarter of the tablet was actually used for cursor control. The rest for UI.</Description>

For that button at least—the most important one—there is none of the left-versus-right confusion that we have with multi-button mice.</Description>

      <Description>These are touch-sensitive MIDI faders that I used in both music and in controlling figures in 3D graphics. They interest me by contrasting them with the Allison/Sneldork sliders: both have about the same travel and both are relative devices. They even use the same gestures. But sensing something mechanical in one and not the other makes the difference as clear as night and day. The answer to why is discovered by pondering the following question, "Does the value change if your fingertip rolls a bit while you stand up while your fingers are on the sliders?"</Description>
